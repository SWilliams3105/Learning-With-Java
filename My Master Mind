			// If the user got any address of the 4 digit number correct, then the program will tell them what numbers they got correct and what place they are in.
			// For example, if the number was 1234, and the places for the number war 0, 1, 2, and 3, where 1 would be in 0, 2 would be in 1, and so on

		}
		//If the user gets the answer correct, then the program will exit, and then loop asking the user if they'd like to play the game again.
		// If the user doesn't get the answer correct, the game will give them 7 more chances to guess the correct number.
		// If all 8 tries are used up, then the program will print out a statement saying that they've failed to guess the correct 
		// number, the correct number will display, and the game will restart if the user says that they want to restart..
